          Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
          efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
          approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
          dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
          language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas
          on most platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
          available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
          Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
          distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers
          to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
          additional information.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and
            data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from
            C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for
            customizable applications.

        <p>The Python interpreter can be installed multiple ways.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.11 on those machines where it is
            available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path
            makes it possible to start it by typing the command: python3.11 into
            the shell.
          </li>
          <li>Installed from the Microsoft Store on Windows machines.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Argument_Passing">
      <header>Argument Passing</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional
          arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to
          the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by
          executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no
          script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string.
          When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input),
          sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set
          to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name
          of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are
          not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in
          sys.argv for the command or module to handle.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Interactive_Mode">
      <header>Interactive Mode</header>
      <article>
        When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in
        interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the
        primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation
        lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...).
        The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and
        a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:
        <code>
          >>> python3.11 Python 3.11 (default, April 4 2021, 09:25:04) [GCC
          10.2.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for
          more information. >>>
        </code>

        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Source_Code_Encoding">
      <header>Source Code Encoding</header>
      <p>
        By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that
        encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used
        simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although
        the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a
        convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these
        characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8,
        and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Inputs,_Outputs,_and_Commenting">
      <header>Inputs, Outputs, and Commenting</header>
      <article>
        Inputs and outputs are distinguished by the presence or absence of
        prompts( >>> and ...):
        <p>
          You can toggle the display of prompts and output by clicking on >>> in
          the upper-right corner of an example box. If you hide the prompts and
          output for an example, then you can easily copy and paste the input
          lines into your interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the
          interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with
          the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
          comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or
          code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a
          string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify
          code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when
          typing in examples.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some examples:
          <code
            >#this is the first comment spam = 1 # and this is the second
            comment # ... and now a third! text = "# This is not a comment
            because it's inside quotes."
          </code>
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
      <header>Numbers</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
          expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
          straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most
          other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be
          used for grouping.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example:
          <code>
            >>> 2 + 2 4 50 - 5*6 20 (50 - 5*6) / 4 5.0 8 / 5 # division always
            returns a floating point number 1.6
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a
          fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more
          about numeric types later in the tutorial. Division (/) always returns
          a float. To do floor division and get an integer result you can use
          the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
        </p>

        <code>
          >>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float 5.666666666666667 >>> 17
          // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part 5 17 % 3 # the %
          operator returns the remainder of the division 2 5 * 3 + 2 # floored
          quotient * divisor + remainder 17</code

      <header>Strings</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be
          expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes
          ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used
          to escape quotes:
        </p>

        <p>
          Python strings cannot be changed — they are immutable. Therefore,
          assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error. If
          you need a different string, you should create a new one.
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
      <header>Lists</header>
      <article>
        <p>
            Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. 
            The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. 
            Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
        </p>

        <code> >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

            >>> squares
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>
        <p>
            Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced.
            All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. 
            This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content.
            You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method (we will see more about methods later).
        </p>

        <p>
            It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for example:
        </p>

        <code
          > >>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']

          >>> n = [1, 2, 3]
          
          >>> x = [a, n]
          
         >>> x
          [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
          
          >>> x[0]
          ['a', 'b', 'c']
          
          >>> x[0][1]
          'b'</code

      <header>if statements</header>
      <article>
        <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation.</li>
              <li>
                An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.
              </li>
              <li>If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or attributes, you may also find the match statement useful. For more details see match Statements.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="for_statements">
      <header>for statements</header>
      <article>
        The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. 
        Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. 
        For example (no pun intended):

        <code> >>> # Measure some strings:

            *** words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
            
            >>> for w in words:
            
            ***    print(w, len(w))
            
            ***
            cat 3
            window 6
            defenestrate 12</code>
        <p>
            Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. 
            Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
        </p>
        <code
          ># Create a sample collection
          users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore': 'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'}
          
          # Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
          for user, status in users.copy().items():
              if status == 'inactive':
                  del users[user]
          
          # Strategy:  Create a new collection
          active_users = {}
          for user, status in users.items():
              if status == 'active':
                  active_users[user] = status
        </code>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="range()_function">
      <header>range() function</header>
      <article>
        <p>If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions:</p>

        <code> >>> for i in range(5):

        ***   print(i)
        
        *** 
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4</code> 
        <p>
            The given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10. 
            It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’)
        </p>

        <p>
            To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len(). 
        </p>

        Example:

        <p>
            A strange thing happens if you just print a range:
        </p>

        <code> >>> range(10)
            range(0, 10)</code>
        <p>
            In many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. 
            It is an object which returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted.</li>
          <li>We have seen that the for statement is such a construct, while an example of a function that takes an iterable is sum()</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as arguments. 
            In chapter Data Structures, we will discuss in more detail about list().
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Defining_Functions">
      <header>Defining Functions</header>
      <article>
        We can create a functions:

        <ul>
          <li>The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.</li>
          <li>
            The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring.
          </li>
          <li>
            The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A function definition associates the function name with the function object in the current symbol table. 
            The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by that name as a user-defined function.
             Other names can also point to that same function object and can also be used to access the function:
        </p>

        <code> >>> fib
            <function fib at 10042ed0>
            
            >>> f = fib
            
            >>> f(100)
            0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89</code>
        <p>
            Coming from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t return a value. 
            In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). 
            Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():
        </p>
        <code> >>> fib(0)

            print(fib(0))
            None</code>
        <p>
            The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None. 
            Falling off the end of a function also returns None.
